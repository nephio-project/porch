A quick reference [Lazy Dog/Lathund](https://watchingtheswedes.com/2021/09/05/swedish-expression-lazy-dog/) of tips,
tricks, workarounds, and shortcuts for developers working with Porch. Please raise a PR to add your Porch magic spells to the Lazy Dog.

## Debugging Starlark scripts

Debugging Starlark scripts can be difficult, especially when running mutation pipelines in Porch. One technique is to put `print` statements in the code to print the value of variables. For example:

```python
def set_package_name(resources, root_kptfile_path, root_package_name):
  for r in resources:
    resource_path = r["metadata"]["annotations"]["internal.config.kubernetes.io/package-path"]
    resource_name = r["metadata"]["annotations"]["config.kubernetes.io/path"]
    print("Resource Path: " + resource_path)
    print("Resource Name: " + resource_name)
```

But that's not enough in Porch.

To force output of the result of partial rendering of failing pipelines in kpt, you must set [the following annotation](https://kpt.dev/book/04-using-functions/#debugging-render-failures) on the `Kptfile`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kpt.dev/v1
kind: Kptfile
metadata:
  name: wordpress
  annotations:
    kpt.dev/save-on-render-failure: "true"
```

You also must set an annotation on the Package Revision so that Porch will [push draft package revisions even when they
fail](https://docs.porch.nephio.org/docs/4_tutorials_and_how-tos/working_with_package_revisions/#troubleshooting).

```bash
kubectl annotate packagerevision <name> porch.kpt.dev/push-on-render-failure=true
```

If the mutation pipeline is passing, you won't get any output from your `print()` statement because Porch assumes
everything is OK and does not print any output. The easiest way to work around this is to put a deliberate runtime error
into your Starlark script, which will cause an error and trigger the output:

```python
  set_package_name(ctx.resource_list["items"], root_kptfile_path, root_package_name)

  i = 10/0 # Deliberate division by zero error
```
