  Caching layer for repository and package data.

## What is the Package Cache?

The **Package Cache** is the intermediary layer between the CaD(configuration as data) Engine and external Git repositories. It maintains in-memory or database-backed representations of repositories, packages, and package revisions to improve performance and reduce load on external repository systems.

The cache is responsible for:

- **Repository Management**: Opening, closing, and tracking repository connections
- **Data Caching**: Storing repository metadata, package revisions, and package resources
- **Background Synchronization**: Periodically refreshing cached data from external repositories
- **Repository Abstraction**: Providing a unified interface regardless of storage backend (Git)
- **Connection Pooling**: Managing connections to external repositories efficiently
- **Change Detection**: Tracking repository versions to detect when updates are needed

## Role in the Architecture

The Package Cache sits between the CaD Engine and Repository Adapters:

```
   CaDEngine
       ↓
  Package Cache
       ↓
    ┌──┴────┐
    ↓       ↓
CR Cache  DB Cache 
    ↓       ↓
Repository Adapter
        ↓
External Repositories (Git)
```

**Key architectural responsibilities:**

1. **Performance Optimization**: Reduces latency by caching repository data in memory or database rather than fetching from Git on every request

2. **Repository Lifecycle Management**: 
   - Opens repositories on first access
   - Maintains repository connections while in use
   - Closes repositories when no longer needed
   - Handles repository sharing when multiple Repository CRs point to the same Git repository

3. **Abstraction Layer**: Provides a consistent `Cache` interface with two implementations:
   - **CR Cache**: Caches package data in-memory, stores PackageRev CR metadata in Kubernetes
   - **DB Cache**: Stores all package data and metadata in a PostgreSQL database

4. **Background Synchronization**:
   - Periodically refreshes repository state from Git repositories to maintain cache consistency
   - Detects new, modified, and deleted package revisions
   - Sends watch events (Added/Modified/Deleted) to notify watchers
   - Implements configurable per-repository synchronization frequency as specified in the spec of the Repository CRD

5. **Repository Adapter Integration**:
   - Creates repository adapter instances (Git adapter)
   - Wraps adapters with caching logic
   - Delegates actual Git operations to adapters
   - Caches adapter responses

6. **Change Notification**:
   - Notifies the Core Engine when package revisions change
   - Enables real-time watch streams for clients
   - Propagates repository updates to watchers

**Cache selection:**

The cache implementation is selected at Porch server startup based on configuration:

- **CR Cache**: Default implementation, stores metadata as Kubernetes resources
- **DB Cache**: Alternative implementation for larger deployments, stores metadata in PostgreSQL

Both implementations provide the same interface and functionality, differing only in storage mechanism and scalability characteristics.

**Singleton pattern:**

The cache is instantiated once during Porch server initialization and shared across all operations. This ensures:
- Consistent view of repository state
- Efficient resource usage
- Centralized synchronization control
