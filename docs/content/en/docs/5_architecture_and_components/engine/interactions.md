## Overall Interaction Overview

![Engine Interaction Architecture](/static/images/porch/engine-component-interaction.drawio.svg)

## Cache Integration

The Engine relies heavily on the Package Cache as its primary interface to repositories:

### Opening Repositories

All repository access goes through the cache:

```
Engine
     ↓
OpenRepository(repositorySpec)
     ↓
Package Cache
     ↓
Repository Adapter (Git)
```

**Process:**
1. Engine receives a Repository CR specification
2. Calls `cache.OpenRepository(ctx, repositorySpec)`
3. Cache returns a Repository interface implementation
4. Engine uses the repository abstraction for all operations

**Benefits of cache-mediated access:**
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed repositories remain in memory
- **Synchronization**: Cache handles background repository sync
- **Abstraction**: Engine doesn't need to know if it's Git or another backend
- **Connection pooling**: Cache manages repository connections efficiently

### Repository Operations

Once a repository is opened, the engine delegates all storage operations:

**Package Revision Operations:**
- `ListPackageRevisions`: Query package revisions with filtering
- `CreatePackageRevisionDraft`: Create mutable draft
- `UpdatePackageRevision`: Open existing revision as draft
- `ClosePackageRevisionDraft`: Commit draft to create immutable revision
- `DeletePackageRevision`: Remove package revision from storage

**Package Operations:**
- `ListPackages`: Query packages
- `CreatePackage`: Initialize new package
- `DeletePackage`: Remove package and all revisions

**Repository Metadata:**
- `Version`: Get repository version for change detection
- `Refresh`: Trigger repository sync
- `Close`: Clean up repository resources

The engine never directly manipulates Git repositories or storage - all operations go through the repository abstraction provided by the cache.

### Cache Invalidation

The engine doesn't directly invalidate cache entries. Instead:

- Cache monitors Repository CRs for changes
- Background sync jobs refresh repository state periodically
- Repository operations (create, update, delete) trigger cache updates automatically
- Engine operations are always performed on the latest cached state

## Task Handler Invocation

The Engine delegates all package transformation operations to the Task Handler:

### Task Execution During Creation

When creating a package revision:

```
Engine
     ↓
ApplyTask(draft, repositoryObj, packageRevision, packageConfig)
     ↓
Task Handler
     ↓
Task Mutations (init, clone, render, etc.)
```

**Process:**
1. Engine creates a draft package revision
2. Calls `taskHandler.ApplyTask()` with:
   - Draft to modify
   - Repository object for context
   - PackageRevision spec with task definition
   - Package configuration (path, name, etc.)
3. Task handler executes the task (init, clone, upgrade)
4. Task handler applies builtin functions (package context generation)
5. Returns modified draft or error

**Task types handled:**
- **Init**: Create new package with Kptfile
- **Clone**: Copy package from upstream
- **Upgrade**: Merge changes from new upstream version
- **Edit**: Create new revision from existing one

### Mutations During Updates

When updating a package revision:

```
Engine
     ↓
DoPRMutations(repoPR, oldObj, newObj, draft)
     ↓
Task Handler
     ↓
Apply new tasks to draft
```

**Process:**
1. Engine opens draft from existing package revision
2. Calls `taskHandler.DoPRMutations()` with old and new specs
3. Task handler compares task lists
4. Applies any new tasks to the draft
5. Returns modified draft

### Resource Mutations

When updating package resources directly:

```
Engine
     ↓
DoPRResourceMutations(pr, draft, oldRes, newRes)
     ↓
Task Handler
     ↓
Update resources + render
```

**Process:**
1. Engine opens draft from package revision
2. Calls `taskHandler.DoPRResourceMutations()` with resource changes
3. Task handler updates package resources
4. Task handler executes render task (runs function pipeline)
5. Returns render status with function results

**Key interaction points:**
- Engine provides the draft workspace
- Task handler modifies resources in the draft
- Engine commits the draft after task completion
- Task handler has no direct repository access

### Function Runtime Integration

The task handler uses function runtimes configured in the engine:

- **Builtin Runtime**: For built-in functions (set-namespace, etc.)
- **gRPC Runtime**: For external function runner service
- **Multi-Runtime**: Chains multiple runtimes together

The engine configures these runtimes during initialization and passes them to the task handler.

## Repository Access

The Engine accesses repositories through a layered abstraction:

### Repository Abstraction Layers

```
Engine
     ↓
Repository Interface (from cache)
     ↓
Repository Adapter (Git)
     ↓
External Repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
```

### Repository Interface

The engine works with the `Repository` interface which provides:

**Package Revision Management:**
- Draft creation and closure
- Listing with filtering
- Deletion

**Package Management:**
- Package listing
- Package creation and deletion

**Repository Metadata:**
- Version tracking
- Refresh operations
- Resource cleanup

This interface is implemented by repository adapters (Git adapter) but the engine never calls adapter code directly.

### Draft Workflow

The engine uses a draft-based workflow for all modifications:

1. **Create/Open Draft**: Get mutable workspace
   - `CreatePackageRevisionDraft`: For new revisions
   - `UpdatePackageRevision`: For existing revisions

2. **Modify Draft**: Apply changes through task handler
   - Draft provides mutable access to package revision resources
   - Changes are isolated until committed

3. **Close Draft**: Commit changes
   - `ClosePackageRevisionDraft`: Persists to repository
   - Creates package revision
   - Generates Git commit or OCI layer

4. **Rollback**: On errors, draft is discarded
   - Ensures atomicity
   - No partial changes persisted

### Credential and Reference Resolution

The engine is configured with resolvers for repository access:

**Credential Resolver:**
- Resolves authentication credentials for repositories
- Supports basic auth, bearer tokens, and GCP workload identity
- Passed to repository adapters through cache
- Engine doesn't handle credentials directly

**Reference Resolver:**
- Resolves package revision references (upstream package revisions)
- Used during clone and upgrade operations
- Enables cross-repository package revision operations

**User Info Provider:**
- Provides authenticated user information
- Used for audit trails (PublishedBy field)
- Extracted from Kubernetes API request context

These resolvers are configured during engine initialization and passed to components that need them.

## Change Notification

The Engine notifies watchers of package revision changes:

### Watcher Manager Integration

```
Engine
     ↓
NotifyPackageRevisionChange(eventType, packageRevision)
     ↓
Watcher Manager
     ↓
API Server Watch Streams
```

**Notification events:**
- **Added**: New package revision created
- **Modified**: Package revision updated (metadata or lifecycle)
- **Deleted**: Package revision removed

**When notifications are sent:**
- After successful package revision creation
- After package revision updates (including lifecycle transitions)
- After metadata-only updates on published packages
- Not sent on failures or during draft operations

### Watch Stream Support

The watcher manager enables Kubernetes watch API support:

1. **Client subscribes**: API server calls `WatchPackageRevisions`
2. **Filter registration**: Watcher manager stores filter and callback
3. **Change notification**: Engine calls `NotifyPackageRevisionChange`
4. **Event delivery**: Watcher manager delivers to matching watchers
5. **Client receives**: Watch event sent to client

**Filter support:**
- Repository name and namespace
- Package name and path
- Workspace name
- Lifecycle state
- Label selectors

Only watchers with matching filters receive notifications.

### Watcher Lifecycle

Watchers are automatically cleaned up:

- When client context is cancelled (connection closed)
- When watcher callback returns false (stop watching)
- Watcher manager periodically removes finished watchers
- No manual cleanup required from engine

The engine simply notifies changes and the watcher manager handles delivery and cleanup.
