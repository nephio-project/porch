**Workspace is merely a unique ID for a package revision!**

The content of this page will shortly be updated to reflect this fact and moved into the PackageRevision page!

## What is a Workspace?

A **workspace** is a named, isolated environment for working on a package revision in Porch. Each Draft or Proposed
package revision has a unique workspace name that identifies the specific set of changes being made to a package.

Workspaces enable:
- Multiple users to work on different changes to the same package simultaneously
- Isolation of work-in-progress changes from published package revisions
- Clear identification of what changes a package revision contains
- Tracking of package revision history and lineage

## How Workspaces Work

When you create a new Draft package revision, you specify a workspace name. This workspace name:

- **Must be unique** within a package (no two package revisions of the same package can share a workspace name)
- **Identifies the changes** contained in that package revision
- **Maps to Git branches** (for Git repositories) in the format `drafts/<package-path>/<workspace-name>`
- **Persists through lifecycle** transitions (Draft → Proposed → Published)

## Workspaces and Lifecycle

Workspaces persist throughout a package revision's lifecycle stages (Draft → Proposed → Published). The workspace name
remains constant, providing continuity as the package revision moves through the stages. For details on lifecycle stages
and transitions, see [Package Lifecycle]({{% relref "/docs/2_concepts/package-revision-lifecycle" %}}).

## Workspace Names

Workspace names should be:
- **Descriptive**: Indicate what changes the package revision contains (e.g., `add-monitoring`, `update-v2`, `fix-rbac`)
- **Unique**: No other package revision of the same package can use the same workspace name
- **Valid**: Follow [Kubernetes naming conventions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#dns-label-names)
  (lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens allowed)

Common patterns:
- Feature-based: `add-feature-x`, `enable-tls`
- Version-based: `v1`, `v2`, `v3` (often auto-generated)

  If a version-based workspace name is used, **do not confuse it** with [revision numbers](#workspace-and-revision-numbers)!

- User-based: `alice-changes`, `bob-update`
- Purpose-based: `security-patch`, `config-update`

## Workspaces and Git

When Porch is installed with the [CR cache]({{% relref "../5_architecture_and_components/porch-server/cache/_index.md#cr-cache-explanation" %}}),
workspace names form part of the branches in Git:

**Draft package revisions**: Stored in branches named `drafts/<package-path>/<workspace-name>`
- Example: `drafts/my-app/add-monitoring`

**Proposed package revisions**: Stored in branches named `proposed/<package-path>/<workspace-name>`
- Example: `proposed/my-app/add-monitoring`

**Published package revisions**: Committed to the `main` branch and tagged
- The workspace name is preserved in the PackageRevision API resource's metadata
- The Git branch is deleted after publication

This Git mapping provides:
- Native Git workflow integration
- Branch-based isolation
- Standard Git operations (diff, merge, rebase) on package changes
- Audit trail through Git history

## Multiple Workspaces on the Same Package

Multiple users can work on the same package simultaneously by using different workspaces to create multiple Draft package
revisions:

```
Package: my-app

Workspace: add-monitoring (Draft)
  - User Alice adding Prometheus configs

Workspace: update-dependencies (Draft)
  - User Bob updating container images

Workspace: v3 (Published)
  - Current production version
```

Each workspace is isolated. Changes in one workspace do not affect package contents until published.

## Workspace and Revision Numbers

Workspaces and revision numbers serve different purposes:

**Workspace name**: Identifies work-in-progress changes (Draft/Proposed)
- Temporary identifier
- User-defined
- Describes the changes

**Revision number**: Identifies published versions
- Permanent identifier
- Auto-assigned by Porch (`1`, `2`, `3`, ...)
- Indicates version sequence

When a package revision is published, it receives a revision number, but the workspace name is preserved for historical
tracking.

## Key Points

- Workspace = arbitrary ID to make a package revision completely unique
- Each Draft/Proposed package revision has a unique workspace name
- Workspace names must be unique within a package
- Workspaces map to Git branches (drafts/ or proposed/ prefixes)
- Multiple workspaces enable concurrent work on the same package
- Workspace names are preserved after publication for tracking
- Workspace names should be descriptive and follow naming conventions
- Workspace names must not be confused with revision numbers
