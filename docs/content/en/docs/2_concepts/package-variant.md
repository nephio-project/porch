  Understanding PackageVariant and PackageVariantSet: automation for package cloning and lifecycle management.

## What are PackageVariants?

A **PackageVariant** is a Kubernetes custom resource that automates the creation and maintenance of downstream package
revisions based on an upstream package. It establishes a relationship between an upstream (source) package and one or
more downstream (target) packages, automatically keeping them synchronized.

PackageVariants enable:
- Automatic cloning of package revisions from upstream to downstream repositories
- Continuous tracking of package revisions of the upstream package
- Automated creation of new downstream revisions when a new revision of the upstream is published
- Customization of downstream package revisions through injectors, functions, and package context

## How PackageVariants Work

Porch's PackageVariant controller watches for changes to:
1. The PackageVariant resource itself
2. The upstream PackageRevision it references
3. The downstream PackageRevisions it owns

When changes occur, the controller:
- Creates a new downstream PackageRevision if none exists (via clone task)
- Updates existing downstream PackageRevisions when upstream changes (via upgrade task)
- Applies customizations specified in the PackageVariant spec (functions, injectors, labels, annotations)
- Manages the lifecycle of downstream PackageRevisions (draft → published)

## PackageVariant Spec

A PackageVariant defines:

**Upstream**: The source PackageRevision to track
```yaml
upstream:
  repo: blueprints
  package: my-app
  revision: v1  # optional: tracks latest if omitted
```

**Downstream**: The target PackageRevision to create/maintain
```yaml
downstream:
  repo: deployments
  package: prod-my-app
```

**Customizations**: How to modify the downstream PackageRevision
- `pipeline`: Additional KRM functions (mutators/validators) to inject into the Kptfile
- `injectors`: References to cluster objects whose data should be injected into the PackageRevision
- `packageContext`: Key-value data to add/remove from the package-context.yaml ConfigMap
- `labels` and `annotations`: Metadata to apply to the downstream PackageRevision

**Policies**:
- `adoptionPolicy`: Whether to adopt existing PackageRevisions (`adoptNone` or `adoptExisting`)
- `deletionPolicy`: Whether to delete or orphan downstream PackageRevisions when the PackageVariant is deleted (`delete`
  or `orphan`)

## PackageVariant Lifecycle

The PackageVariant controller manages downstream PackageRevisions through their lifecycle:

1. **Initial creation**: Creates a Draft PackageRevision with a clone task
2. **Customization**: Applies functions, injectors, and package context modifications
3. **Upstream updates**: When upstream changes, creates a new Draft with an upgrade task
4. **Downstream modifications**: When customizations change, creates a new Draft with an edit task
5. **Cleanup**: When PackageVariant is deleted, deletes or orphans downstream PackageRevisions based on deletionPolicy

## What are PackageVariantSets?

**PackageVariantSet** is a higher-level resource that creates multiple PackageVariants from a single upstream package to
multiple downstream targets. It's essentially a template for generating PackageVariants.

PackageVariantSets enable:
- One-to-many package distribution (one upstream → many downstreams)
- Dynamic target selection via label selectors
- Templated downstream package naming and customization
- Centralized management of multiple PackageVariants

## PackageVariantSet Spec

A PackageVariantSet defines:

**Upstream**: The source PackageRevision (same as PackageVariant)

**Targets**: How to select downstream repositories
- `repositories`: Explicit list of Repository resources
- `repositorySelector`: Label selector to dynamically select repositories
- `objectSelector`: Selector against arbitrary cluster objects

**Template**: How to generate each PackageVariant
- Defines the spec for generated PackageVariants
- Supports CEL expressions for dynamic values (e.g., `packageExpr`, `repoExpr`)
- Can customize labels, annotations, pipeline, injectors per target

## PackageVariantSet Behavior

The PackageVariantSet controller:
1. Evaluates target selectors to determine downstream repositories
2. Creates a PackageVariant resource for each target
3. Applies the template to customize each PackageVariant
4. Manages the lifecycle of generated PackageVariants
5. Updates PackageVariants when the PackageVariantSet changes

## Key Points

- PackageVariant automates the upstream → downstream relationship between package revisions
- The controller creates and updates downstream PackageRevisions automatically
- Customizations (functions, injectors, context) are applied to downstream PackageRevisions
- PackageVariantSet creates multiple PackageVariants from a single definition
- Both resources use Kubernetes controller patterns for reconciliation
- Adoption and deletion policies control how existing PackageRevisions are handled on PackageVariant creation and deletion
