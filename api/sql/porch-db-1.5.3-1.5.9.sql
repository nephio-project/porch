-- Add the kptfile_status column to cache Kptfile-derived status fields
-- (conditions, upstreamLock) needed for serving PackageRevision API queries
-- without re-parsing the Kptfile YAML on every read.
--
-- Existing rows default to '{}'. The Porch server automatically backfills
-- this column on startup by reading each Kptfile resource from the resources
-- table, parsing it, and storing the extracted status. It also backfills
-- the spec column with readinessGates and packageMetadata from the Kptfile.
-- No manual resync is required.

ALTER TABLE package_revisions
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS kptfile_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}';
