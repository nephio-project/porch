                  LatestRevision identifies the package revision that is the latest
                  published package revision belonging to this package. Latest is determined by comparing
                  packages that have valid semantic version as their revision. In case of git backend, branch tracking
                  revisions like "main" and in case of oci backend, revisions tracking "latest" are not considered during
                  selection of the latest revision.
