# This defines the build for goreleaser (https://goreleaser.com/). It is
# executed through a Github Action that is triggered by new tags being created
# in the porch repo.
# As porch needs to be compiled with CGO, we cannot simply just provide a simple
# matrix of GOOS and GOARCH combinations, but instead, we'd need to define separate
# steps for each targeted OS and ARCH. This is because we need to specify the
# platform specific C std library (libc) and cross-compiler to be used.
